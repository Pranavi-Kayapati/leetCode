### [258. Add Digits](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-digits/)

##### Easy

Given an integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit, and return it.

Example 1:

```JS
Input: num = 38
Output: 2
```

Explanation: 
```JS
The process is
38 --> 3 + 8 --> 11
11 --> 1 + 1 --> 2 
Since 2 has only one digit, return it.
```

Example 2:
```JS
Input: num = 0
Output: 0
```

Constraints:
```JS
0 <= num <= 231 - 1
```
